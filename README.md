A minimal notes application in [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose) with [MVVM architecture](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/guide).
Built with components like DataStore, Coroutines, ViewModel, Flow-State, Room, Navigation-Compose, Coil, koin etc.


#### This App showcases:

* UI state management
* Basic Material Design theming (Light & Dark)
* Integration with Architecture Components: Navigation, ViewModel, Room

This is the first step for [Paper](https://github.com/akshay2211/paper) in becoming a full fledged Notes application with all the desired features
currently this is the first phase which included a basic working good Ui App.
